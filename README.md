Mexican automobile production has exploded over the last decade, vaulting the country into being the world's seventh largest auto producer and, in a matter of years, it's expected to become the 5th largest. This is thanks in large part to the billions of dollars auto giants such as General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler are pouring into the country to build assembly plants. And the boom is expected to further expand as companies are making new investments in moving production to Mexico.

The investments have not only changed Mexico's national economy but have drastically morphed local economies where assembly plants and supply factories are built. The city of Saltillo in the northwest has been dubbed "The Detroit of Mexico" because of how ingrained auto production is in the labor market.    

I'd like to visualize data showing just how meteoric Mexico's rise has been as an automobile producer and how local labor markets practically run on auto production. Using trade data from 1962-2015 from the UN and from the Center for International Data from Robert Feenstra, I'd like to show how Mexico's exports have grown to be dominated by the automobile, the vast majority of which go to the U.S. An area plot showing the relative size of exports for each sector. I'm also considering overalying this on a map of Mexico and running a timeline loop where a color scheme shows where auto production has increased the most since 1962. I can put in a time stamp pause for when NAFTA was enacted. 

I will also show with a map the change in countries which Mexico exports to, using a map with overlayed lines. I'll use heavier connecting lines to indicate overall value (autos). 

I'm also looking in to aquiring local data on GDP growth in Mexican states where auto assembly plants have been built and what percentage of GDP automobile production accounts for. Should this pan out, I think a heat map of where GDP growth is hottest in the country could be useful. 

Looking forward to talking this over more.
